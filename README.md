Protofs is a prototype for a fluid physics simulation.

While the final project is supposed to be multithread optimized, protofs will most likley not get multithread capabilities. Nontheless the planed multithread optimization of the final project is the reason why protofs is build up like it is.

This project is not meant to become a fully featured fluid physic simulation. Neither it is meant to be used in any final prducts.  
It is just a prototype to help figuring out what steps have to be calculatet to make a fluid physics simulation like that happening.
And also to see how a simulation build this way reacts in certain situations. 

Protofs is written in lua and runs in [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page).  
The final project will be complety rewritten in C++ and most likeley be embedded in the Unreal Engine 5.
